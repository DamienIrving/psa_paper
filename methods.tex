\section{Methodology}

Most existing climatologies of Rossby wave activity tend to focus on zonally propagating waves, with the Fourier transform applied along adjacent lines of constant latitude \citep[e.g.][]{IrvingSimmonds2015,Glatt2014}.  

For the new approach, we rotate coordinate system such that we can search along a great circle path (i.e. the equator in the rotated world). At each data time, we then search the rotated meridional wind anomaly data along the new equator after isolating the relevant domain. Details of the Fourier transform for that data time were then used to determine whether or not there was an active PSA pattern and what the phase and amplitude of that pattern were.
