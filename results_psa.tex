\subsection{The PSA pattern}

In defining the PSA pattern according to the peaks of the PSA-like phase distribution, it was necessary to account for seasonal variations in the location of those peaks (Figure \ref{fig:phase_distribution}). A spread of 15$^{\circ}$ was considered sufficient to capture these variations and hence the 15$^{\circ}$ interval about the two local maxima containing the highest local values (taken from the 1979-2014 annual Guassian kernel density estimate) was determined. This approach was taken to account of the fact that the phase histograms were not symmetrical about the local maxima and yielded two intervals corresponding to the positive (4.5-19.5$^{\circ}$E) and negative (37.5-52.5$^{\circ}$E) phase of the PSA pattern.

\subsubsection{Trends and variability}

During autumn and winter in particular, the middle years of the study period (\~1991-2002) were characterized by a predominance of positive PSA events, while negative events have been more common in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:phase_distribution}). This variability is reflected in the linear trends observed over that time, with negative phase events showing a statistically significant increasing trend (at the $p < 0.05$ level) on an annual basis and smaller non-significant increasing trends in summer, autumn and winter (Figure \ref{fig:psa-neg_seasonality}). Positive phase events showed a non-significant decreasing trend on an annual basis and also during autumn and winter, and an increasing trend during summer (Figure \ref{fig:psa-pos_seasonality}). Consistent with previous studies, both polarities of the PSA pattern showed a preference for winter and spring (Figure \ref{fig:psa-pos_seasonality} and \ref{fig:psa-neg_seasonality}).

\subsubsection{Influence on surface variables} 

In order to assess the influence of the PSA pattern on regional climate variability, the composite mean surface air temperature anomaly, precipitation anomaly and sea ice concentration anomaly was calculated for both the positive and negative phase (Figure \ref{fig:surface_composites}). On the western flank of the central composite-mean streamfunction anomaly associated with positive phase events, anomalously warm conditions were evident over the Ross Sea, Amundsen Sea and interior of West Antactica, particularly during autumn and winter. The northerly flow responsible for those warm conditions also induced large precipitation increases along the West Antarctic coastline and reduced sea ice in the Amundsen Sea. On the eastern flank, anomalously cool conditions were evident over the Antarctic Peninsula, Patagonia and the Weddell Sea during all seasons (winter and spring especially), with the latter also experiencing large increases in sea ice. Anomalously dry conditions were also seen over the Antarcitc Peninsula in association with the weaker westerly flow. 

The pronounced positive streamfunction anomaly over the Indian Ocean in the PSA pattern composites gives the impression of a hemispheric zonal wavenumber three pattern, however the phase of that pattern and the unremarkable negative anomalies either side Indian Ocean anomaly are inconsistent with the characteristics of the dominant SH zonal wavenumber three mode \citep[e.g.][]{Raphael2004,IrvingSimmonds2015}.

\subsubsection{SAM and ENSO}

ENSO/SAM relationship (ad a neutral area to the plot - want to know what percentage is not associated with strong ENSO). The SAM/ENSO coupling discussed by \citet{Fogt2006} is evident, but not super pronounced and doesn't explain the trends (Figure \ref{fig:sam_v_enso})
