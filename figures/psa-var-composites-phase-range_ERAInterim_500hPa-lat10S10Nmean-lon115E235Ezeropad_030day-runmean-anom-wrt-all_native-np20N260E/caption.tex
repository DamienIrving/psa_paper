\label{fig:surface_composites}
Composite mean surface air temperature anomaly, precipitation anomaly and sea ice fraction anomaly for days (with 30-day running mean applied) of positive (phase grouping 4.5 to 19.5$^{\circ}$E; top row) or negative (37.5 to 52.5$^{\circ}$E; bottom row) PSA pattern polarity. Black contours show the corresponding composite mean 500 hPa streamfunction anomaly (dashed contours indicate negative values and the contour interval is $2.5 \times 10^6 \: m^2 s^{-1}$), while the hatching shows regions where the difference between the composite mean and climatological mean is significant at the $p < 0.01$ level.
