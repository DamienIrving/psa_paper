\label{fig:lifecycle}
Lifecycle characteristics of PSA-like variability. The distribution of event duration is shown in panel (a), while the phase of all events lasting more than 10 days is shown in panel (b). Events that showed substantial forward (defined as a linear phase gradient of greater than $0.25^{\circ}$E per day) or backward (less than $-0.25^{\circ}$E per day) propagation were colored red and blue respectively, otherwise grey shading was used. The intensity of the shading in panel (b) represents the amplitude of the PSA-like variability.
