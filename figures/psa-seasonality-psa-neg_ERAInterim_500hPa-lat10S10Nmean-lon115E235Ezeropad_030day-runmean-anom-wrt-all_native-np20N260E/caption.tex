\label{fig:psa-neg_seasonality}
Variability and trends in the negative polarity of the PSA pattern. The total PSA-negative days for each individual season are shown in panel (a), corresponding seasonal linear trends in panel (c) (black represents the annual trend) and monthly totals for the entire study period (1979-2014) in panel (b). To account for the fact that not all months have an equal number of days, the counts for each month are presented as a percentage of the total number of days for that month. Years in panel (a) are defined from December to November (e.g. the `year' 1980 spans December 1979 to November 1980) and it should be noted that the `days' in this context have had a 30-day running mean applied.
