\label{fig:sam_v_enso}
The SAM versus Ni\~{n}o 3.4 for all data times (shown in black) over the period 1979-2014. Dots corresponding to PSA-positive and PSA-negative data times were re-colored red and blue respectively and for clarity only every seventh data time was plotted. Corresponding histograms and kernel density estimates for the SAM (top panel) and Ni\~{n}o 3.4 (right panel) are shown and have been scaled according to density as opposed to frequency (hence the amplitudes are comparable).
