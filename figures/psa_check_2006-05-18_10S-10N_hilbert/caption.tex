\label{fig:transform}
Fourier analysis of the meridional average (10$^{\circ}$S-10$^{\circ}$N) 500 hPa rotated meridional wind anomaly for a 30-day mean centered on 18 May 2006 (purple curve). The individual Fourier components for wavenumbers 1-8 (grey dashed, with wavenumbers 5 and 6 highlighted in green), reconstructed signal from an inverse Fourier transform with wavenumbers 4-7 retained (dashed orange) and its corresponding wave envelope (solid orange) are all shown. The inset shows the amplitude of each of the individual Fourier components.
