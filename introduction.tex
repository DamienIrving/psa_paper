\section{Introduction}

The Pacific South-American (PSA) pattern comprises of a negative sea level pressure (or upper-tropospheric geopotential height) anomaly east of New Zealand, a positive anomaly in the south-east Pacific over the Amundsen Sea, and a negative anomaly over the South America / Weddell Sea region. The name was coined by Mo & Ghil 1987, but a number of papers around that time identified this recurrent and persistent pattern in the SH circulation.
