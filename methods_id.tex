\section{Methodology}

Many existing climatologies of Rossby wave activity focus on zonally propagating waves, whereby the wave identification method simply applies a Fourier transform along adjacent lines of constant latitude \citep[e.g.][]{Glatt2014,IrvingSimmonds2015}. More sophisticated methods have been developed for tracking non-zonal synoptic-scale Rossby wave packets \citep[e.g.][]{Zimin2006,Souders2014}, however such sophistication was not needed in devising a method for objectively identifying the PSA pattern. Instead, it was possible to make use of the fact that the pattern traces an approximate great circle path. By rotating the global coordinate system such that the equator (itself a great circle path) traces the approximate path of the PSA pattern, our identification algorithm could simply apply a Fourier transform along the equator in the new zonal direction. The algorithm is described in detail below, along with the other more general data analysis techniques used in the study.
