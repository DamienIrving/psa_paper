\section{Methodology}

Many existing climatologies of Rossby wave activity focus on zonally propagating waves, whereby the wave identification method simply applies a Fourier transform along adjacent lines of constant latitude \citep[e.g.][]{Glatt2014,IrvingSimmonds2015}. More sophisticated methods have been developed for tracking non-zonal synoptic-scale Rossby wave packets \citep[e.g.][]{Zimin2006,Souders2014}, however such sophistication was not needed in devising a method for objectively identifying the PSA pattern. Instead, it was possible to make use of the fact that the pattern traces an approximate great circle path. By rotating the global coordinate system such that the equator (itself a great circle path) traces the approximate path of the PSA pattern, our identification algorithm could simply apply a Fourier transform along the equator in the new zonal direction. This algorithm is described below, along with the other more general data analysis techniques used in the study.

\subsection{Identification algorithm}

\subsubsection{Grid rotation}

In order to align the new equator with the approximate path of the PSA pattern, a global 0.75$^{\circ}$ latitude by 0.75$^{\circ}$ longitude grid was defined (i.e. the same resolution as the original ERA-Interim data) with the north pole located at 20$^{\circ}$N, 260$^{\circ}$E. The 500 hPa zonal and meridional wind data were used to re-calculate the meridional wind relative to the new north, and then the temporal anomaly of this new meridional wind was linearly interpolated to the rotated grid for use in the Fourier transform (e.g. FIGURE 2). It should be noted that existing zonal wave studies \citep[e.g.][]{IrvingSimmonds2015} tend to skip this final step of calculating the anomaly, because in the case of zonal waves the temporal mean of the meridional wind is typically close to zero (and hence waveforms defined by the meridional wind already oscillate about zero). 

On this rotated grid, the search region of interest was defined as the area bounded by 10$^{\circ}$S to 10$^{\circ}$N and 115$^{\circ}$E to 235$^{\circ}$E. This region was selected via visual comparison with existing definitions of the PSA pattern (e.g. FIGURE 1), however the final results were not sensitive to small changes in pole location or search region bounds.

\subsubsection{Fourier transform}

To prepare the meridional wind anomaly for Fourier transform, the meridional mean was calculated over 10$^{\circ}$S to 10$^{\circ}$N (in order to eliminate the latitudinal dimension) and then values outside of 115$^{\circ}$E to 235$^{\circ}$E were set to zero. Zero padding is a commonly used technique in signal processing when the waveform of interest does not complete an integer number of cycles in a given domain, and is equivalent to multiplying the original signal (in this case the meridional mean meridional wind anomaly) by a square window function. This multiplication (or convolution) of two waves has consequences in frequency space, such that even the periodogram (or Fourier line spectrum) for a perfectly sinusoidal signal that would repeat exactly six times (for example) over the zero padded domain would show power at more than one frequency. This phenomenon is known as spectral leakage and arises because the square window function is not square in frequency space. In analyses where this leakage is undesirable, a Hanning or Hamming window will be used instead. In the frequency space these windows don't have so much spread into the sidelobes, which has the result of producing a periodogram that has less spread into the sidelobes, but the main lobes are flattened out more (i.e. the focus frequency won't have the full value).
