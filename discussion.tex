\section{Discussion}

How is it that recent high latitude trends are associated with an atmospheric circulation that resembles the PSA pattern, but a climatology of PSA pattern activity does not reveal trends consistent with that finding? For winter at least, the answer to that question may have been uncovered by \citet{Li2015a}. They analyze the Rossby wave trains associated with observed SST trends in the tropical Atlantic, tropical Indian, west Pacific and east Pacific regions and find that all four have a center of action over the Amundsen Sea. While none of these individual wave trains resemble the PSA pattern, a linear combination of the four of them does (with the tropical Atlantic and west Pacific identified as most influential). In other words, the integrated influence of tropical SST trends on the atmospheric circulation resembles the PSA pattern, but the waves underpinning that teleconnection do not. This result is consistent with earlier studies that identified the possible influence of the tropical Atlantic on West Antartic trends \citep{Li2014,Simpkins2014} and goes to the heart of the argument made at the beginning of this paper: for a proposed teleconnection to be robust, it must go both ways.
